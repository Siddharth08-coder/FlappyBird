# FlappyBird
An android app which is replica of famous game-> FlappyBird


The game is supported by an open source library: "Gdx Library" --> https://libgdx.com/ && https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/

The animation and rendering is achived throgh using a series of images which on playing on a contineous loop creates an illustration of a bird flapping wings. When screen is touched the bird flies up to cross the tubes and create a score. If it interactes with Any of the Tube it looses the game and the game is paused which then restarts when screen is touched again.

This app is developed by Siddharth Singh during his second semester while pursuaing B.TECH.

NOTE: The developer does not own any of the images, text and material used while creating this app. This app is a combination of various resources available over the internet.

Thank you. Enjoy Coding!! :)
